Gas Price Model
## Gas Demand module
### Residential and Commercial Sector
This sector gas demand may be considered as a function of days with low temperature, elasticity of gas demand in respect to GDP, and elasticity of gas demand in respect to gas price. The GDP elasticity is generally about 0.38-0.42 for the residential sector and 0.59-0.61 for the commercial sector. The gas price elasticity is generally less than 0.09-0.11 for both sectors. Since gas demand in these sectors is relatively inelastic, GDP and price changes have small effects on demand.
### Industrial Sector
This sector gas demand may be considered as a function of growth in output, the energy intensity trend, the price elasticity, the amount of gas-to-oil switching.
#### Chemical Sector
This sector gas demand may be considered as a function of demand for ammonia, methanol, and non-refinery hydrogen. The model relates the growth to GDP and natural gas prices. As GDP growth increases, chemical industry production increases; and as gas prices increase, chemical industry production decreases.
